;------------------------------ JITTER BUFFER CONFIGURATION --------------------------
jbenable = yes              ; Enables the use of a jitterbuffer on the receiving side of a
                              ; SIP channel. Defaults to "no". An enabled jitterbuffer will
                              ; be used only if the sending side can create and the receiving
                              ; side can not accept jitter. The SIP channel can accept jitter,
                              ; thus a jitterbuffer on the receive SIP side will be used only
                              ; if it is forced and enabled.

; jbforce = yes                ; Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive side of a SIP
                              ; channel. Defaults to "no".

; jbmaxsize = 200             ; Max length of the jitterbuffer in milliseconds.

; jbresyncthreshold = 1000    ; Jump in the frame timestamps over which the jitterbuffer is
                              ; resynchronized. Useful to improve the quality of the voice, with
                              ; big jumps in/broken timestamps, usually sent from exotic devices
                              ; and programs. Defaults to 1000.

; jbimpl = fixed              ; Jitterbuffer implementation, used on the receiving side of a SIP
                              ; channel. Two implementations are currently available - "fixed"
                              ; (with size always equals to jbmaxsize) and "adaptive" (with
                              ; variable size, actually the new jb of IAX2). Defaults to fixed.

; jblog = no                  ; Enables jitterbuffer frame logging. Defaults to "no".
